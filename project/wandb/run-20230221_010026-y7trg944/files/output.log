2023-02-21 01:00:47.785845: E tensorflow/compiler/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_blas.cc:221] Failure to initialize cublas may be due to OOM (cublas needs some free memory when you initialize it, and your deep-learning framework may have preallocated more than its fair share), or may be because this binary was not built with support for the GPU in your machine.
