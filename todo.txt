Backtesting the Tripple SMA => DONE. Its result is heavily influenced by market up and down.
Optimize Tripple SMA => DONE. Heavily influenced by market up and down
Implement MACD strategy => DONE.
Backtesting MACD => DONE
Optimize MACD => The max multiple is only 0.8. A bit disappointed. The culprit is the trading cost. The robot made a lot of trades.
Add machine learning => Added SVM with parameters as history recent price, history recent price of correlated asset, trade volumn change. Highest accuracy is 54%. Can I make it 70%???
Normalization data before feeding to SVM => DONE. Doesnt make much difference
Optimize SVM Classifier with parameter combination => DONE. Take a lot of time. Will run again after Cloud Computing
Add 1d historical data => Added for BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT
Reduce trade number to achieve higher result with MACD
